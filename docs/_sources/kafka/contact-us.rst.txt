Contact Mailing Lists

We have a few mailing lists hosted by Apache:

::

   User mailing list: A list for general user questions about Kafka®. To subscribe, send an email to users-subscribe@kafka.apache.org. Once subscribed, send your emails to users@kafka.apache.org. Archives are available here.
   Developer mailing list: A list for discussion on Kafka® development. To subscribe, send an email to dev-subscribe@kafka.apache.org. Once subscribed, send your emails to dev@kafka.apache.org. Archives are available here.
   JIRA mailing list: A list to track Kafka® JIRA notifications. To subscribe, send an email to jira-subscribe@kafka.apache.org. Archives are available here.
   Commit mailing list: A list to track Kafka® commits. To subscribe, send an email to commits-subscribe@kafka.apache.org. Archives are available here.

A searchable archive of the mailing lists is available at
search-hadoop.com.

To unsubscribe from any of these you just change the word “subscribe” to
“unsubscribe” in the email adresses above.

Prior to the move to Apache we had a Google group we used for
discussion. Archives can be found here. After that we were in Apache
Incubator which has its own archives for user, dev, and commit lists.
IRC

We have an IRC channel where there is often a few people hanging around
if you want an interactive discussion. You can find us on
chat.freenode.net in #apache-kafka room (previously #kafka). The irc log
can be found here.
