<h2>1.1 Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>Apache Kafka® is a distributed streaming platform. What exactly does that mean?
A streaming platform has three key capabilities:</p>
<p>Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.
Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.
Process streams of records as they occur.
Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:</p>
<p>Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data
To understand how Kafka does these things, let’s dive in and explore Kafka’s capabilities from the bottom up.</p>
<p>First a few concepts:</p>
<p>Kafka is run as a cluster on one or more servers that can span multiple datacenters.
The Kafka cluster stores streams of records in categories called topics.
Each record consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp.
Kafka has four core APIs:</p>
<p>The Producer API allows an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics.
The Consumer API allows an application to subscribe to one or more topics and process the stream of records produced to them.
The Streams API allows an application to act as a stream processor, consuming an input stream from one or more topics and producing an output stream to one or more output topics, effectively transforming the input streams to output streams.
The Connector API allows building and running reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka topics to existing applications or data systems. For example, a connector to a relational database might capture every change to a table.</p>
<p>In Kafka the communication between the clients and the servers is done with a simple, high-performance, language agnostic TCP protocol. This protocol is versioned and maintains backwards compatibility with older version. We provide a Java client for Kafka, but clients are available in many languages.</p>
<p>Topics and Logs
Let’s first dive into the core abstraction Kafka provides for a stream of records—the topic.</p>
<p>A topic is a category or feed name to which records are published. Topics in Kafka are always multi-subscriber; that is, a topic can have zero, one, or many consumers that subscribe to the data written to it.</p>
<p>For each topic, the Kafka cluster maintains a partitioned log that looks like this:</p>
<p>Each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records that is continually appended to—a structured commit log. The records in the partitions are each assigned a sequential id number called the offset that uniquely identifies each record within the partition.</p>
<p>The Kafka cluster durably persists all published records—whether or not they have been consumed—using a configurable retention period. For example, if the retention policy is set to two days, then for the two days after a record is published, it is available for consumption, after which it will be discarded to free up space. Kafka’s performance is effectively constant with respect to data size so storing data for a long time is not a problem.</p>
<p>In fact, the only metadata retained on a per-consumer basis is the offset or position of that consumer in the log. This offset is controlled by the consumer: normally a consumer will advance its offset linearly as it reads records, but, in fact, since the position is controlled by the consumer it can consume records in any order it likes. For example a consumer can reset to an older offset to reprocess data from the past or skip ahead to the most recent record and start consuming from “now”.</p>
<p>This combination of features means that Kafka consumers are very cheap—they can come and go without much impact on the cluster or on other consumers. For example, you can use our command line tools to “tail” the contents of any topic without changing what is consumed by any existing consumers.</p>
<p>The partitions in the log serve several purposes. First, they allow the log to scale beyond a size that will fit on a single server. Each individual partition must fit on the servers that host it, but a topic may have many partitions so it can handle an arbitrary amount of data. Second they act as the unit of parallelism—more on that in a bit.</p>
<p>Distribution
The partitions of the log are distributed over the servers in the Kafka cluster with each server handling data and requests for a share of the partitions. Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance.</p>
<p>Each partition has one server which acts as the “leader” and zero or more servers which act as “followers”. The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition while the followers passively replicate the leader. If the leader fails, one of the followers will automatically become the new leader. Each server acts as a leader for some of its partitions and a follower for others so load is well balanced within the cluster.</p>
<p>Geo-Replication
Kafka MirrorMaker provides geo-replication support for your clusters. With MirrorMaker, messages are replicated across multiple datacenters or cloud regions. You can use this in active/passive scenarios for backup and recovery; or in active/active scenarios to place data closer to your users, or support data locality requirements.</p>
<p>Producers
Producers publish data to the topics of their choice. The producer is responsible for choosing which record to assign to which partition within the topic. This can be done in a round-robin fashion simply to balance load or it can be done according to some semantic partition function (say based on some key in the record). More on the use of partitioning in a second!</p>
<p>Consumers
Consumers label themselves with a consumer group name, and each record published to a topic is delivered to one consumer instance within each subscribing consumer group. Consumer instances can be in separate processes or on separate machines.</p>
<p>If all the consumer instances have the same consumer group, then the records will effectively be load balanced over the consumer instances.</p>
<p>If all the consumer instances have different consumer groups, then each record will be broadcast to all the consumer processes.</p>
<p>A two server Kafka cluster hosting four partitions (P0-P3) with two consumer groups. Consumer group A has two consumer instances and group B has four.</p>
<p>More commonly, however, we have found that topics have a small number of consumer groups, one for each “logical subscriber”. Each group is composed of many consumer instances for scalability and fault tolerance. This is nothing more than publish-subscribe semantics where the subscriber is a cluster of consumers instead of a single process.</p>
<p>The way consumption is implemented in Kafka is by dividing up the partitions in the log over the consumer instances so that each instance is the exclusive consumer of a “fair share” of partitions at any point in time. This process of maintaining membership in the group is handled by the Kafka protocol dynamically. If new instances join the group they will take over some partitions from other members of the group; if an instance dies, its partitions will be distributed to the remaining instances.</p>
<p>Kafka only provides a total order over records within a partition, not between different partitions in a topic. Per-partition ordering combined with the ability to partition data by key is sufficient for most applications. However, if you require a total order over records this can be achieved with a topic that has only one partition, though this will mean only one consumer process per consumer group.</p>
<p>Multi-tenancy
You can deploy Kafka as a multi-tenant solution. Multi-tenancy is enabled by configuring which topics can produce or consume data. There is also operations support for quotas. Administrators can define and enforce quotas on requests to control the broker resources that are used by clients. For more information, see the security documentation.</p>
<p>Guarantees
At a high-level Kafka gives the following guarantees:</p>
<p>Messages sent by a producer to a particular topic partition will be appended in the order they are sent. That is, if a record M1 is sent by the same producer as a record M2, and M1 is sent first, then M1 will have a lower offset than M2 and appear earlier in the log.
A consumer instance sees records in the order they are stored in the log.
For a topic with replication factor N, we will tolerate up to N-1 server failures without losing any records committed to the log.
More details on these guarantees are given in the design section of the documentation.</p>
<p>Kafka as a Messaging System
How does Kafka’s notion of streams compare to a traditional enterprise messaging system?</p>
<p>Messaging traditionally has two models: queuing and publish-subscribe. In a queue, a pool of consumers may read from a server and each record goes to one of them; in publish-subscribe the record is broadcast to all consumers. Each of these two models has a strength and a weakness. The strength of queuing is that it allows you to divide up the processing of data over multiple consumer instances, which lets you scale your processing. Unfortunately, queues aren’t multi-subscriber—once one process reads the data it’s gone. Publish-subscribe allows you broadcast data to multiple processes, but has no way of scaling processing since every message goes to every subscriber.</p>
<p>The consumer group concept in Kafka generalizes these two concepts. As with a queue the consumer group allows you to divide up processing over a collection of processes (the members of the consumer group). As with publish-subscribe, Kafka allows you to broadcast messages to multiple consumer groups.</p>
<p>The advantage of Kafka’s model is that every topic has both these properties—it can scale processing and is also multi-subscriber—there is no need to choose one or the other.</p>
<p>Kafka has stronger ordering guarantees than a traditional messaging system, too.</p>
<p>A traditional queue retains records in-order on the server, and if multiple consumers consume from the queue then the server hands out records in the order they are stored. However, although the server hands out records in order, the records are delivered asynchronously to consumers, so they may arrive out of order on different consumers. This effectively means the ordering of the records is lost in the presence of parallel consumption. Messaging systems often work around this by having a notion of “exclusive consumer” that allows only one process to consume from a queue, but of course this means that there is no parallelism in processing.</p>
<p>Kafka does it better. By having a notion of parallelism—the partition—within the topics, Kafka is able to provide both ordering guarantees and load balancing over a pool of consumer processes. This is achieved by assigning the partitions in the topic to the consumers in the consumer group so that each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group. By doing this we ensure that the consumer is the only reader of that partition and consumes the data in order. Since there are many partitions this still balances the load over many consumer instances. Note however that there cannot be more consumer instances in a consumer group than partitions.</p>
<p>Kafka as a Storage System
Any message queue that allows publishing messages decoupled from consuming them is effectively acting as a storage system for the in-flight messages. What is different about Kafka is that it is a very good storage system.</p>
<p>Data written to Kafka is written to disk and replicated for fault-tolerance. Kafka allows producers to wait on acknowledgement so that a write isn’t considered complete until it is fully replicated and guaranteed to persist even if the server written to fails.</p>
<p>The disk structures Kafka uses scale well—Kafka will perform the same whether you have 50 KB or 50 TB of persistent data on the server.</p>
<p>As a result of taking storage seriously and allowing the clients to control their read position, you can think of Kafka as a kind of special purpose distributed filesystem dedicated to high-performance, low-latency commit log storage, replication, and propagation.</p>
<p>For details about the Kafka’s commit log storage and replication design, please read this page.</p>
<p>Kafka for Stream Processing
It isn’t enough to just read, write, and store streams of data, the purpose is to enable real-time processing of streams.</p>
<p>In Kafka a stream processor is anything that takes continual streams of data from input topics, performs some processing on this input, and produces continual streams of data to output topics.</p>
<p>For example, a retail application might take in input streams of sales and shipments, and output a stream of reorders and price adjustments computed off this data.</p>
<p>It is possible to do simple processing directly using the producer and consumer APIs. However for more complex transformations Kafka provides a fully integrated Streams API. This allows building applications that do non-trivial processing that compute aggregations off of streams or join streams together.</p>
<p>This facility helps solve the hard problems this type of application faces: handling out-of-order data, reprocessing input as code changes, performing stateful computations, etc.</p>
<p>The streams API builds on the core primitives Kafka provides: it uses the producer and consumer APIs for input, uses Kafka for stateful storage, and uses the same group mechanism for fault tolerance among the stream processor instances.</p>
<p>Putting the Pieces Together
This combination of messaging, storage, and stream processing may seem unusual but it is essential to Kafka’s role as a streaming platform.</p>
<p>A distributed file system like HDFS allows storing static files for batch processing. Effectively a system like this allows storing and processing historical data from the past.</p>
<p>A traditional enterprise messaging system allows processing future messages that will arrive after you subscribe. Applications built in this way process future data as it arrives.</p>
<p>Kafka combines both of these capabilities, and the combination is critical both for Kafka usage as a platform for streaming applications as well as for streaming data pipelines.</p>
<p>By combining storage and low-latency subscriptions, streaming applications can treat both past and future data the same way. That is a single application can process historical, stored data but rather than ending when it reaches the last record it can keep processing as future data arrives. This is a generalized notion of stream processing that subsumes batch processing as well as message-driven applications.</p>
<p>Likewise for streaming data pipelines the combination of subscription to real-time events make it possible to use Kafka for very low-latency pipelines; but the ability to store data reliably make it possible to use it for critical data where the delivery of data must be guaranteed or for integration with offline systems that load data only periodically or may go down for extended periods of time for maintenance. The stream processing facilities make it possible to transform data as it arrives.</p>

<div class="section" id="use-cases">
<h2>1.2 Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>Here is a description of a few of the popular use cases for Apache Kafka®. For an overview of a number of these areas in action, see this blog post.</p>
<p>Messaging
Kafka works well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker. Message brokers are used for a variety of reasons (to decouple processing from data producers, to buffer unprocessed messages, etc). In comparison to most messaging systems Kafka has better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault-tolerance which makes it a good solution for large scale message processing applications.
In our experience messaging uses are often comparatively low-throughput, but may require low end-to-end latency and often depend on the strong durability guarantees Kafka provides.</p>
<p>In this domain Kafka is comparable to traditional messaging systems such as ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ.</p>
<p>Website Activity Tracking
The original use case for Kafka was to be able to rebuild a user activity tracking pipeline as a set of real-time publish-subscribe feeds. This means site activity (page views, searches, or other actions users may take) is published to central topics with one topic per activity type. These feeds are available for subscription for a range of use cases including real-time processing, real-time monitoring, and loading into Hadoop or offline data warehousing systems for offline processing and reporting.
Activity tracking is often very high volume as many activity messages are generated for each user page view.</p>
<p>Metrics
Kafka is often used for operational monitoring data. This involves aggregating statistics from distributed applications to produce centralized feeds of operational data.
Log Aggregation
Many people use Kafka as a replacement for a log aggregation solution. Log aggregation typically collects physical log files off servers and puts them in a central place (a file server or HDFS perhaps) for processing. Kafka abstracts away the details of files and gives a cleaner abstraction of log or event data as a stream of messages. This allows for lower-latency processing and easier support for multiple data sources and distributed data consumption. In comparison to log-centric systems like Scribe or Flume, Kafka offers equally good performance, stronger durability guarantees due to replication, and much lower end-to-end latency.
Stream Processing
Many users of Kafka process data in processing pipelines consisting of multiple stages, where raw input data is consumed from Kafka topics and then aggregated, enriched, or otherwise transformed into new topics for further consumption or follow-up processing. For example, a processing pipeline for recommending news articles might crawl article content from RSS feeds and publish it to an “articles” topic; further processing might normalize or deduplicate this content and published the cleansed article content to a new topic; a final processing stage might attempt to recommend this content to users. Such processing pipelines create graphs of real-time data flows based on the individual topics. Starting in 0.10.0.0, a light-weight but powerful stream processing library called Kafka Streams is available in Apache Kafka to perform such data processing as described above. Apart from Kafka Streams, alternative open source stream processing tools include Apache Storm and Apache Samza.
Event Sourcing
Event sourcing is a style of application design where state changes are logged as a time-ordered sequence of records. Kafka’s support for very large stored log data makes it an excellent backend for an application built in this style.
Commit Log
Kafka can serve as a kind of external commit-log for a distributed system. The log helps replicate data between nodes and acts as a re-syncing mechanism for failed nodes to restore their data. The log compaction feature in Kafka helps support this usage. In this usage Kafka is similar to Apache BookKeeper project.</p>

<div class="section" id="quick-start">
<h2>1.3 Quick Start<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-start" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial assumes you are starting fresh and have no existing Kafka or ZooKeeper data. Since Kafka console scripts are different for Unix-based and Windows platforms, on Windows platforms use binwindowsinstead of bin/, and change the script extension to .bat.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download the code
Download the 2.3.0 release and un-tar it.
1
2
&gt; tar -xzf kafka_2.12-2.3.0.tgz
&gt; cd kafka_2.12-2.3.0
Step 2: Start the server
Kafka uses ZooKeeper so you need to first start a ZooKeeper server if you don’t already have one. You can use the convenience script packaged with kafka to get a quick-and-dirty single-node ZooKeeper instance.</p>
<p>1
2
3
&gt; bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
[2013-04-22 15:01:37,495] INFO Reading configuration from: config/zookeeper.properties (org.apache.zookeeper.server.quorum.QuorumPeerConfig)
…
Now start the Kafka server:</p>
<p>1
2
3
4
&gt; bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
[2013-04-22 15:01:47,028] INFO Verifying properties (kafka.utils.VerifiableProperties)
[2013-04-22 15:01:47,051] INFO Property socket.send.buffer.bytes is overridden to 1048576 (kafka.utils.VerifiableProperties)
…
Step 3: Create a topic
Let’s create a topic named “test” with a single partition and only one replica:</p>
<p>1
&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh –create –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –replication-factor 1 –partitions 1 –topic test
We can now see that topic if we run the list topic command:</p>
<p>1
2
&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh –list –bootstrap-server localhost:9092
test
Alternatively, instead of manually creating topics you can also configure your brokers to auto-create topics when a non-existent topic is published to.</p>
<p>Step 4: Send some messages
Kafka comes with a command line client that will take input from a file or from standard input and send it out as messages to the Kafka cluster. By default, each line will be sent as a separate message.</p>
<p>Run the producer and then type a few messages into the console to send to the server.</p>
<p>1
2
3
&gt; bin/kafka-console-producer.sh –broker-list localhost:9092 –topic test
This is a message
This is another message
Step 5: Start a consumer
Kafka also has a command line consumer that will dump out messages to standard output.</p>
<p>1
2
3
&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –topic test –from-beginning
This is a message
This is another message
If you have each of the above commands running in a different terminal then you should now be able to type messages into the producer terminal and see them appear in the consumer terminal.</p>
<p>All of the command line tools have additional options; running the command with no arguments will display usage information documenting them in more detail.</p>
<p>Step 6: Setting up a multi-broker cluster
So far we have been running against a single broker, but that’s no fun. For Kafka, a single broker is just a cluster of size one, so nothing much changes other than starting a few more broker instances. But just to get feel for it, let’s expand our cluster to three nodes (still all on our local machine).</p>
<p>First we make a config file for each of the brokers (on Windows use the copy command instead):</p>
<p>1
2
&gt; cp config/server.properties config/server-1.properties
&gt; cp config/server.properties config/server-2.properties
Now edit these new files and set the following properties:</p>
<p>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
config/server-1.properties:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>broker.id=1
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9093
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs-1</p>
</div></blockquote>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>config/server-2.properties:</dt><dd><p>broker.id=2
listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9094
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs-2</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The broker.id property is the unique and permanent name of each node in the cluster. We have to override the port and log directory only because we are running these all on the same machine and we want to keep the brokers from all trying to register on the same port or overwrite each other’s data.</p>
<p>We already have Zookeeper and our single node started, so we just need to start the two new nodes:</p>
<p>1

Now create a new topic with a replication factor of three:</p>
<p>1
&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh –create –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –replication-factor 3 –partitions 1 –topic my-replicated-topic
Okay but now that we have a cluster how can we know which broker is doing what? To see that run the “describe topics” command:</p>
<p>1
2
3
&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh –describe –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –topic my-replicated-topic
Topic:my-replicated-topic   PartitionCount:1    ReplicationFactor:3 Configs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Topic: my-replicated-topic  Partition: 0    Leader: 1   Replicas: 1,2,0 Isr: 1,2,0</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Here is an explanation of output. The first line gives a summary of all the partitions, each additional line gives information about one partition. Since we have only one partition for this topic there is only one line.</p>
<p>“leader” is the node responsible for all reads and writes for the given partition. Each node will be the leader for a randomly selected portion of the partitions.
“replicas” is the list of nodes that replicate the log for this partition regardless of whether they are the leader or even if they are currently alive.
“isr” is the set of “in-sync” replicas. This is the subset of the replicas list that is currently alive and caught-up to the leader.
Note that in my example node 1 is the leader for the only partition of the topic.</p>
<p>We can run the same command on the original topic we created to see where it is:</p>
<p>1
2
3
&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh –describe –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –topic test
Topic:test  PartitionCount:1    ReplicationFactor:1 Configs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Topic: test Partition: 0    Leader: 0   Replicas: 0 Isr: 0</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So there is no surprise there—the original topic has no replicas and is on server 0, the only server in our cluster when we created it.</p>
<p>Let’s publish a few messages to our new topic:</p>
<p>1
2
3
4
5
&gt; bin/kafka-console-producer.sh –broker-list localhost:9092 –topic my-replicated-topic
…
my test message 1
my test message 2
^C
Now let’s consume these messages:</p>
<p>1
2
3
4
5
&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –from-beginning –topic my-replicated-topic
…
my test message 1
my test message 2
^C
Now let’s test out fault-tolerance. Broker 1 was acting as the leader so let’s kill it:</p>
<p>1
2
3
&gt; ps aux | grep server-1.properties
7564 ttys002    0:15.91 /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.8/Home/bin/java…
&gt; kill -9 7564
On Windows use:
1
2
3
4
&gt; wmic process where “caption = ‘java.exe’ and commandline like ‘%server-1.properties%’” get processid
ProcessId
6016
&gt; taskkill /pid 6016 /f
Leadership has switched to one of the followers and node 1 is no longer in the in-sync replica set:</p>
<p>1
2
3
&gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh –describe –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –topic my-replicated-topic
Topic:my-replicated-topic   PartitionCount:1    ReplicationFactor:3 Configs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Topic: my-replicated-topic  Partition: 0    Leader: 2   Replicas: 1,2,0 Isr: 2,0</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>But the messages are still available for consumption even though the leader that took the writes originally is down:</p>
<p>1

&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –from-beginning –topic my-replicated-topic

Step 7: Use Kafka Connect to import/export data
Writing data from the console and writing it back to the console is a convenient place to start, but you’ll probably want to use data from other sources or export data from Kafka to other systems. For many systems, instead of writing custom integration code you can use Kafka Connect to import or export data.</p>
<p>Kafka Connect is a tool included with Kafka that imports and exports data to Kafka. It is an extensible tool that runs connectors, which implement the custom logic for interacting with an external system. In this quickstart we’ll see how to run Kafka Connect with simple connectors that import data from a file to a Kafka topic and export data from a Kafka topic to a file.</p>
<p>First, we’ll start by creating some seed data to test with:</p>
<p>1
&gt; echo -e “foonbar” &gt; test.txt
Or on Windows:
1
2
&gt; echo foo&gt; test.txt
&gt; echo bar&gt;&gt; test.txt
Next, we’ll start two connectors running in standalone mode, which means they run in a single, local, dedicated process. We provide three configuration files as parameters. The first is always the configuration for the Kafka Connect process, containing common configuration such as the Kafka brokers to connect to and the serialization format for data. The remaining configuration files each specify a connector to create. These files include a unique connector name, the connector class to instantiate, and any other configuration required by the connector.</p>
<p>1
&gt; bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/connect-file-source.properties config/connect-file-sink.properties
These sample configuration files, included with Kafka, use the default local cluster configuration you started earlier and create two connectors: the first is a source connector that reads lines from an input file and produces each to a Kafka topic and the second is a sink connector that reads messages from a Kafka topic and produces each as a line in an output file.</p>
<p>During startup you’ll see a number of log messages, including some indicating that the connectors are being instantiated. Once the Kafka Connect process has started, the source connector should start reading lines from test.txt and producing them to the topic connect-test, and the sink connector should start reading messages from the topic connect-test and write them to the file test.sink.txt. We can verify the data has been delivered through the entire pipeline by examining the contents of the output file:</p>
<p>1
2
3
&gt; more test.sink.txt
foo
bar
Note that the data is being stored in the Kafka topic connect-test, so we can also run a console consumer to see the data in the topic (or use custom consumer code to process it):</p>
<p>1
2
3
4
&gt; bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh –bootstrap-server localhost:9092 –topic connect-test –from-beginning
{“schema”:{“type”:”string”,”optional”:false},”payload”:”foo”}
{“schema”:{“type”:”string”,”optional”:false},”payload”:”bar”}
…
The connectors continue to process data, so we can add data to the file and see it move through the pipeline:</p>
<p>1
&gt; echo Another line&gt;&gt; test.txt
You should see the line appear in the console consumer output and in the sink file.</p>
<p>Step 8: Use Kafka Streams to process data
Kafka Streams is a client library for building mission-critical real-time applications and microservices, where the input and/or output data is stored in Kafka clusters. Kafka Streams combines the simplicity of writing and deploying standard Java and Scala applications on the client side with the benefits of Kafka’s server-side cluster technology to make these applications highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, distributed, and much more. This quickstart example will demonstrate how to run a streaming application coded in this library.</p>

<h2>1.5 Upgrading From Previous Versions<a class="headerlink" href="#upgrading-from-previous-versions" title="永久链接至标题">¶</a></h2>
<p>Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x or 2.1.x or 2.2.x to 2.3.0
If you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.1.x, please see the note below about the change to the schema used to store consumer offsets. Once you have changed the inter.broker.protocol.version to the latest version, it will not be possible to downgrade to a version prior to 2.1.</p>
<p>For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden the message format version, you should keep its current value. Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2, 0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0, 1.0, 1.1).
log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)
If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x, or 2.1.x, and you have not overridden the message format, then you only need to override the inter-broker protocol version.
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0, 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2).
Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the code, and restart it. Once you have done so, the brokers will be running the latest version and you can verify that the cluster’s behavior and performance meets expectations. It is still possible to downgrade at this point if there are any problems.
Once the cluster’s behavior and performance has been verified, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 2.3.
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect. Once the brokers begin using the latest protocol version, it will no longer be possible to downgrade the cluster to an older version.
If you have overridden the message format version as instructed above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.3 on each broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala clients, which are no longer maintained, do not support the message format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid conversion costs (or to take advantage of exactly once semantics), the newer Java clients must be used.
Notable changes in 2.3.0
We are introducing a new rebalancing protocol for Kafka Connect based on incremental cooperative rebalancing. The new protocol does not require stopping all the tasks during a rebalancing phase between Connect workers. Instead, only the tasks that need to be exchanged between workers are stopped and they are started in a follow up rebalance. The new Connect protocol is enabled by default beginning with 2.3.0. For more details on how it works and how to enable the old behavior of eager rebalancing, checkout incremental cooperative rebalancing design.
We are introducing static membership towards consumer user. This feature reduces unnecessary rebalances during normal application upgrades or rolling bounces. For more details on how to use it, checkout static membership design.
Kafka Streams DSL switches its used store types. While this change is mainly transparent to users, there are some corner cases that may require code changes. See the Kafka Streams upgrade section for more details.

Notable changes in 2.2.0
The default consumer group id has been changed from the empty string (“”) to null. Consumers who use the new default group id will not be able to subscribe to topics, and fetch or commit offsets. The empty string as consumer group id is deprecated but will be supported until a future major release. Old clients that rely on the empty string group id will now have to explicitly provide it as part of their consumer config. For more information see KIP-289.
The bin/kafka-topics.sh command line tool is now able to connect directly to brokers with –bootstrap-server instead of zookeeper. The old –zookeeper option is still available for now. Please read KIP-377 for more information.
Kafka Streams depends on a newer version of RocksDBs that requires MacOS 10.13 or higher.

Additional Upgrade Notes:</p>
<p>Offset expiration semantics has slightly changed in this version. According to the new semantics, offsets of partitions in a group will not be removed while the group is subscribed to the corresponding topic and is still active (has active consumers). If group becomes empty all its offsets will be removed after default offset retention period (or the one set by broker) has passed (unless the group becomes active again). Offsets associated with standalone (simple) consumers, that do not use Kafka group management, will be removed after default offset retention period (or the one set by broker) has passed since their last commit.
The default for console consumer’s enable.auto.commit property when no group.id is provided is now set to false. This is to avoid polluting the consumer coordinator cache as the auto-generated group is not likely to be used by other consumers.
The default value for the producer’s retries config was changed to Integer.MAX_VALUE, as we introduced delivery.timeout.ms in KIP-91, which sets an upper bound on the total time between sending a record and receiving acknowledgement from the broker. By default, the delivery timeout is set to 2 minutes.
By default, MirrorMaker now overrides delivery.timeout.ms to Integer.MAX_VALUE when configuring the producer. If you have overridden the value of retries in order to fail faster, you will instead need to override delivery.timeout.ms.
The ListGroup API now expects, as a recommended alternative, Describe Group access to the groups a user should be able to list. Even though the old Describe Cluster access is still supported for backward compatibility, using it for this API is not advised.
KIP-336 deprecates the ExtendedSerializer and ExtendedDeserializer interfaces and propagates the usage of Serializer and Deserializer. ExtendedSerializer and ExtendedDeserializer were introduced with KIP-82 to provide record headers for serializers and deserializers in a Java 7 compatible fashion. Now we consolidated these interfaces as Java 7 support has been dropped since.
Notable changes in 2.1.0
Jetty has been upgraded to 9.4.12, which excludes TLS_RSA_* ciphers by default because they do not support forward secrecy, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/2807">https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/2807</a> for more information.
Unclean leader election is automatically enabled by the controller when unclean.leader.election.enable config is dynamically updated by using per-topic config override.
The AdminClient has added a method AdminClient#metrics(). Now any application using the AdminClient can gain more information and insight by viewing the metrics captured from the AdminClient. For more information see KIP-324
Kafka now supports Zstandard compression from KIP-110. You must upgrade the broker as well as clients to make use of it. Consumers prior to 2.1.0 will not be able to read from topics which use Zstandard compression, so you should not enable it for a topic until all downstream consumers are upgraded. See the KIP for more detail.
Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, or 1.1.x to 2.0.0
Kafka 2.0.0 introduces wire protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade. However, please review the notable changes in 2.0.0 before upgrading.</p>
<p>For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden the message format version, you should keep its current value. Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2, 0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0, 1.0, 1.1).
log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)
If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x, 1.0.x, or 1.1.x and you have not overridden the message format, then you only need to override the inter-broker protocol format.
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0, 1.0, 1.1).
Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the code, and restart it.
Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 2.0.
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect.
If you have overridden the message format version as instructed above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 2.0 on each broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala consumer does not support the new message format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid the performance cost of down-conversion (or to take advantage of exactly once semantics), the newer Java consumer must be used.
Additional Upgrade Notes:</p>
<p>If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will start with the new protocol by default.
Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after. Similarly for the message format version.
If you are using Java8 method references in your Kafka Streams code you might need to update your code to resolve method ambiguities. Hot-swapping the jar-file only might not work.
ACLs should not be added to prefixed resources, (added in KIP-290), until all brokers in the cluster have been updated.
NOTE: any prefixed ACLs added to a cluster, even after the cluster is fully upgraded, will be ignored should the cluster be downgraded again.</p>
<p>Notable changes in 2.0.0
KIP-186 increases the default offset retention time from 1 day to 7 days. This makes it less likely to “lose” offsets in an application that commits infrequently. It also increases the active set of offsets and therefore can increase memory usage on the broker. Note that the console consumer currently enables offset commit by default and can be the source of a large number of offsets which this change will now preserve for 7 days instead of 1. You can preserve the existing behavior by setting the broker config offsets.retention.minutes to 1440.
Support for Java 7 has been dropped, Java 8 is now the minimum version required.
The default value for ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm was changed to https, which performs hostname verification (man-in-the-middle attacks are possible otherwise). Set ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm to an empty string to restore the previous behaviour.
KAFKA-5674 extends the lower interval of max.connections.per.ip minimum to zero and therefore allows IP-based filtering of inbound connections.
KIP-272 added API version tag to the metric kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=RequestsPerSec,request={Produce|FetchConsumer|FetchFollower|…}. This metric now becomes kafka.network:type=RequestMetrics,name=RequestsPerSec,request={Produce|FetchConsumer|FetchFollower|…},version={0|1|2|3|…}. This will impact JMX monitoring tools that do not automatically aggregate. To get the total count for a specific request type, the tool needs to be updated to aggregate across different versions.
KIP-225 changed the metric “records.lag” to use tags for topic and partition. The original version with the name format “{topic}-{partition}.records-lag” has been removed.
The Scala consumers, which have been deprecated since 0.11.0.0, have been removed. The Java consumer has been the recommended option since 0.10.0.0. Note that the Scala consumers in 1.1.0 (and older) will continue to work even if the brokers are upgraded to 2.0.0.
The Scala producers, which have been deprecated since 0.10.0.0, have been removed. The Java producer has been the recommended option since 0.9.0.0. Note that the behaviour of the default partitioner in the Java producer differs from the default partitioner in the Scala producers. Users migrating should consider configuring a custom partitioner that retains the previous behaviour. Note that the Scala producers in 1.1.0 (and older) will continue to work even if the brokers are upgraded to 2.0.0.
MirrorMaker and ConsoleConsumer no longer support the Scala consumer, they always use the Java consumer.
The ConsoleProducer no longer supports the Scala producer, it always uses the Java producer.
A number of deprecated tools that rely on the Scala clients have been removed: ReplayLogProducer, SimpleConsumerPerformance, SimpleConsumerShell, ExportZkOffsets, ImportZkOffsets, UpdateOffsetsInZK, VerifyConsumerRebalance.
The deprecated kafka.tools.ProducerPerformance has been removed, please use org.apache.kafka.tools.ProducerPerformance.
New Kafka Streams configuration parameter upgrade.from added that allows rolling bounce upgrade from older version.
KIP-284 changed the retention time for Kafka Streams repartition topics by setting its default value to Long.MAX_VALUE.
Updated ProcessorStateManager APIs in Kafka Streams for registering state stores to the processor topology. For more details please read the Streams Upgrade Guide.
In earlier releases, Connect’s worker configuration required the internal.key.converter and internal.value.converter properties. In 2.0, these are no longer required and default to the JSON converter. You may safely remove these properties from your Connect standalone and distributed worker configurations:
internal.key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter internal.key.converter.schemas.enable=false internal.value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter internal.value.converter.schemas.enable=false
KIP-266 adds a new consumer configuration default.api.timeout.ms to specify the default timeout to use for KafkaConsumer APIs that could block. The KIP also adds overloads for such blocking APIs to support specifying a specific timeout to use for each of them instead of using the default timeout set by default.api.timeout.ms. In particular, a new poll(Duration) API has been added which does not block for dynamic partition assignment. The old poll(long) API has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Overloads have also been added for other KafkaConsumer methods like partitionsFor, listTopics, offsetsForTimes, beginningOffsets, endOffsets and close that take in a Duration.
Also as part of KIP-266, the default value of request.timeout.ms has been changed to 30 seconds. The previous value was a little higher than 5 minutes to account for maximum time that a rebalance would take. Now we treat the JoinGroup request in the rebalance as a special case and use a value derived from max.poll.interval.ms for the request timeout. All other request types use the timeout defined by request.timeout.ms
The internal method kafka.admin.AdminClient.deleteRecordsBefore has been removed. Users are encouraged to migrate to org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.AdminClient.deleteRecords.
The AclCommand tool –producer convenience option uses the KIP-277 finer grained ACL on the given topic.
KIP-176 removes the –new-consumer option for all consumer based tools. This option is redundant since the new consumer is automatically used if –bootstrap-server is defined.
KIP-290 adds the ability to define ACLs on prefixed resources, e.g. any topic starting with ‘foo’.
KIP-283 improves message down-conversion handling on Kafka broker, which has typically been a memory-intensive operation. The KIP adds a mechanism by which the operation becomes less memory intensive by down-converting chunks of partition data at a time which helps put an upper bound on memory consumption. With this improvement, there is a change in FetchResponse protocol behavior where the broker could send an oversized message batch towards the end of the response with an invalid offset. Such oversized messages must be ignored by consumer clients, as is done by KafkaConsumer.
KIP-283 also adds new topic and broker configurations message.downconversion.enable and log.message.downconversion.enable respectively to control whether down-conversion is enabled. When disabled, broker does not perform any down-conversion and instead sends an UNSUPPORTED_VERSION error to the client.</p>
<p>Dynamic broker configuration options can be stored in ZooKeeper using kafka-configs.sh before brokers are started. This option can be used to avoid storing clear passwords in server.properties as all password configs may be stored encrypted in ZooKeeper.
ZooKeeper hosts are now re-resolved if connection attempt fails. But if your ZooKeeper host names resolve to multiple addresses and some of them are not reachable, then you may need to increase the connection timeout zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms.
New Protocol Versions
KIP-279: OffsetsForLeaderEpochResponse v1 introduces a partition-level leader_epoch field.
KIP-219: Bump up the protocol versions of non-cluster action requests and responses that are throttled on quota violation.
KIP-290: Bump up the protocol versions ACL create, describe and delete requests and responses.
Upgrading a 1.1 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 1.1 to 2.0 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 2.0 application can connect to 2.0, 1.1, 1.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
Note that in 2.0 we have removed the public APIs that are deprecated prior to 1.0; users leveraging on those deprecated APIs need to make code changes accordingly. See Streams API changes in 2.0.0 for more details.
Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x, 0.11.0.x, or 1.0.x to 1.1.x
Kafka 1.1.0 introduces wire protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade. However, please review the notable changes in 1.1.0 before upgrading.</p>
<p>For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden the message format version, you should keep its current value. Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2, 0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0, 1.0).
log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)
If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x or 1.0.x and you have not overridden the message format, then you only need to override the inter-broker protocol format.
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (0.11.0 or 1.0).
Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the code, and restart it.
Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 1.1.
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect.
If you have overridden the message format version as instructed above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 1.1 on each broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala consumer does not support the new message format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid the performance cost of down-conversion (or to take advantage of exactly once semantics), the newer Java consumer must be used.
Additional Upgrade Notes:</p>
<p>If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will start with the new protocol by default.
Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after. Similarly for the message format version.
If you are using Java8 method references in your Kafka Streams code you might need to update your code to resolve method ambiguties. Hot-swapping the jar-file only might not work.
Notable changes in 1.1.1
New Kafka Streams configuration parameter upgrade.from added that allows rolling bounce upgrade from version 0.10.0.x
See the Kafka Streams upgrade guide for details about this new config.
Notable changes in 1.1.0
The kafka artifact in Maven no longer depends on log4j or slf4j-log4j12. Similarly to the kafka-clients artifact, users can now choose the logging back-end by including the appropriate slf4j module (slf4j-log4j12, logback, etc.). The release tarball still includes log4j and slf4j-log4j12.
KIP-225 changed the metric “records.lag” to use tags for topic and partition. The original version with the name format “{topic}-{partition}.records-lag” is deprecated and will be removed in 2.0.0.
Kafka Streams is more robust against broker communication errors. Instead of stopping the Kafka Streams client with a fatal exception, Kafka Streams tries to self-heal and reconnect to the cluster. Using the new AdminClient you have better control of how often Kafka Streams retries and can configure fine-grained timeouts (instead of hard coded retries as in older version).
Kafka Streams rebalance time was reduced further making Kafka Streams more responsive.
Kafka Connect now supports message headers in both sink and source connectors, and to manipulate them via simple message transforms. Connectors must be changed to explicitly use them. A new HeaderConverter is introduced to control how headers are (de)serialized, and the new “SimpleHeaderConverter” is used by default to use string representations of values.
kafka.tools.DumpLogSegments now automatically sets deep-iteration option if print-data-log is enabled explicitly or implicitly due to any of the other options like decoder.
New Protocol Versions
KIP-226 introduced DescribeConfigs Request/Response v1.
KIP-227 introduced Fetch Request/Response v7.
Upgrading a 1.0 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 1.0 to 1.1 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 1.1 application can connect to 1.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
See Streams API changes in 1.1.0 for more details.
Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x, 0.10.2.x or 0.11.0.x to 1.0.0
Kafka 1.0.0 introduces wire protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade. However, please review the notable changes in 1.0.0 before upgrading.</p>
<p>For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the message format version currently in use. If you have previously overridden the message format version, you should keep its current value. Alternatively, if you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.11.0.x, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2, 0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.10.2, 0.11.0).
log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)
If you are upgrading from 0.11.0.x and you have not overridden the message format, you must set both the message format version and the inter-broker protocol version to 0.11.0.
inter.broker.protocol.version=0.11.0
log.message.format.version=0.11.0
Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the code, and restart it.
Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 1.0.
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect.
If you have overridden the message format version as instructed above, then you need to do one more rolling restart to upgrade it to its latest version. Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded to 0.11.0 or later, change log.message.format.version to 1.0 on each broker and restart them one by one. If you are upgrading from 0.11.0 and log.message.format.version is set to 0.11.0, you can update the config and skip the rolling restart. Note that the older Scala consumer does not support the new message format introduced in 0.11, so to avoid the performance cost of down-conversion (or to take advantage of exactly once semantics), the newer Java consumer must be used.
Additional Upgrade Notes:</p>
<p>If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will start with the new protocol by default.
Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after. Similarly for the message format version.
Notable changes in 1.0.2
New Kafka Streams configuration parameter upgrade.from added that allows rolling bounce upgrade from version 0.10.0.x
See the Kafka Streams upgrade guide for details about this new config.
Notable changes in 1.0.1
Restored binary compatibility of AdminClient’s Options classes (e.g. CreateTopicsOptions, DeleteTopicsOptions, etc.) with 0.11.0.x. Binary (but not source) compatibility had been broken inadvertently in 1.0.0.
Notable changes in 1.0.0
Topic deletion is now enabled by default, since the functionality is now stable. Users who wish to to retain the previous behavior should set the broker config delete.topic.enable to false. Keep in mind that topic deletion removes data and the operation is not reversible (i.e. there is no “undelete” operation)
For topics that support timestamp search if no offset can be found for a partition, that partition is now included in the search result with a null offset value. Previously, the partition was not included in the map. This change was made to make the search behavior consistent with the case of topics not supporting timestamp search.
If the inter.broker.protocol.version is 1.0 or later, a broker will now stay online to serve replicas on live log directories even if there are offline log directories. A log directory may become offline due to IOException caused by hardware failure. Users need to monitor the per-broker metric offlineLogDirectoryCount to check whether there is offline log directory.
Added KafkaStorageException which is a retriable exception. KafkaStorageException will be converted to NotLeaderForPartitionException in the response if the version of client’s FetchRequest or ProducerRequest does not support KafkaStorageException.
-XX:+DisableExplicitGC was replaced by -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent in the default JVM settings. This helps avoid out of memory exceptions during allocation of native memory by direct buffers in some cases.
The overridden handleError method implementations have been removed from the following deprecated classes in the kafka.api package: FetchRequest, GroupCoordinatorRequest, OffsetCommitRequest, OffsetFetchRequest, OffsetRequest, ProducerRequest, and TopicMetadataRequest. This was only intended for use on the broker, but it is no longer in use and the implementations have not been maintained. A stub implementation has been retained for binary compatibility.
The Java clients and tools now accept any string as a client-id.
The deprecated tool kafka-consumer-offset-checker.sh has been removed. Use kafka-consumer-groups.sh to get consumer group details.
SimpleAclAuthorizer now logs access denials to the authorizer log by default.
Authentication failures are now reported to clients as one of the subclasses of AuthenticationException. No retries will be performed if a client connection fails authentication.
Custom SaslServer implementations may throw SaslAuthenticationException to provide an error message to return to clients indicating the reason for authentication failure. Implementors should take care not to include any security-critical information in the exception message that should not be leaked to unauthenticated clients.
The app-info mbean registered with JMX to provide version and commit id will be deprecated and replaced with metrics providing these attributes.
Kafka metrics may now contain non-numeric values. org.apache.kafka.common.Metric#value() has been deprecated and will return 0.0 in such cases to minimise the probability of breaking users who read the value of every client metric (via a MetricsReporter implementation or by calling the metrics() method). org.apache.kafka.common.Metric#metricValue() can be used to retrieve numeric and non-numeric metric values.
Every Kafka rate metric now has a corresponding cumulative count metric with the suffix -total to simplify downstream processing. For example, records-consumed-rate has a corresponding metric named records-consumed-total.
Mx4j will only be enabled if the system property kafka_mx4jenable is set to true. Due to a logic inversion bug, it was previously enabled by default and disabled if kafka_mx4jenable was set to true.
The package org.apache.kafka.common.security.auth in the clients jar has been made public and added to the javadocs. Internal classes which had previously been located in this package have been moved elsewhere.
When using an Authorizer and a user doesn’t have required permissions on a topic, the broker will return TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED errors to requests irrespective of topic existence on broker. If the user have required permissions and the topic doesn’t exists, then the UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION error code will be returned.
config/consumer.properties file updated to use new consumer config properties.
New Protocol Versions
KIP-112: LeaderAndIsrRequest v1 introduces a partition-level is_new field.
KIP-112: UpdateMetadataRequest v4 introduces a partition-level offline_replicas field.
KIP-112: MetadataResponse v5 introduces a partition-level offline_replicas field.
KIP-112: ProduceResponse v4 introduces error code for KafkaStorageException.
KIP-112: FetchResponse v6 introduces error code for KafkaStorageException.
KIP-152: SaslAuthenticate request has been added to enable reporting of authentication failures. This request will be used if the SaslHandshake request version is greater than 0.
Upgrading a 0.11.0 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.11.0 to 1.0 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 1.0 application can connect to 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though). However, Kafka Streams 1.0 requires 0.10 message format or newer and does not work with older message formats.
If you are monitoring on streams metrics, you will need make some changes to the metrics names in your reporting and monitoring code, because the metrics sensor hierarchy was changed.
There are a few public APIs including ProcessorContext#schedule(), Processor#punctuate() and KStreamBuilder, TopologyBuilder are being deprecated by new APIs. We recommend making corresponding code changes, which should be very minor since the new APIs look quite similar, when you upgrade.
See Streams API changes in 1.0.0 for more details.
Upgrading a 0.10.2 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.2 to 1.0 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 1.0 application can connect to 1.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
If you are monitoring on streams metrics, you will need make some changes to the metrics names in your reporting and monitoring code, because the metrics sensor hierarchy was changed.
There are a few public APIs including ProcessorContext#schedule(), Processor#punctuate() and KStreamBuilder, TopologyBuilder are being deprecated by new APIs. We recommend making corresponding code changes, which should be very minor since the new APIs look quite similar, when you upgrade.
If you specify customized key.serde, value.serde and timestamp.extractor in configs, it is recommended to use their replaced configure parameter as these configs are deprecated.
See Streams API changes in 0.11.0 for more details.
Upgrading a 0.10.1 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.1 to 1.0 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 1.0 application can connect to 1.0, 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
You need to recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and will break your application.

If you register custom metrics, you will need to update this code, because the StreamsMetric interface was changed.
See Streams API changes in 1.0.0, Streams API changes in 0.11.0 and Streams API changes in 0.10.2 for more details.
Upgrading a 0.10.0 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.0 to 1.0 does require a broker upgrade because a Kafka Streams 1.0 application can only connect to 0.1, 0.11.0, 0.10.2, or 0.10.1 brokers.
There are couple of API changes, that are not backward compatible (cf. Streams API changes in 1.0.0, Streams API changes in 0.11.0, Streams API changes in 0.10.2, and Streams API changes in 0.10.1 for more details). Thus, you need to update and recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and will break your application.
Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 1.0.2 requires two rolling bounces with config upgrade.from=”0.10.0” set for first upgrade phase (cf. KIP-268). As an alternative, an offline upgrade is also possible.
prepare your application instances for a rolling bounce and make sure that config upgrade.from is set to “0.10.0” for new version 0.11.0.3
bounce each instance of your application once
prepare your newly deployed 1.0.2 application instances for a second round of rolling bounces; make sure to remove the value for config upgrade.mode
bounce each instance of your application once more to complete the upgrade
Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 requires an offline upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)
stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances
update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code and new jar file
restart all new (1.0.0 or 1.0.1) application instances
Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x, 0.10.1.x or 0.10.2.x to 0.11.0.0
Kafka 0.11.0.0 introduces a new message format version as well as wire protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade. However, please review the notable changes in 0.11.0.0 before upgrading.</p>
<p>Starting with version 0.10.2, Java clients (producer and consumer) have acquired the ability to communicate with older brokers. Version 0.11.0 clients can talk to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers. However, if your brokers are older than 0.10.0, you must upgrade all the brokers in the Kafka cluster before upgrading your clients. Version 0.11.0 brokers support 0.8.x and newer clients.</p>
<p>For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties on all brokers and add the following properties. CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION refers to the version you are upgrading from. CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION refers to the current message format version currently in use. If you have not overridden the message format previously, then CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION should be set to match CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION.
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2, 0.9.0, 0.10.0, 0.10.1 or 0.10.2).
log.message.format.version=CURRENT_MESSAGE_FORMAT_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)
Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the code, and restart it.
Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.11.0, but do not change log.message.format.version yet.
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect.
Once all (or most) consumers have been upgraded to 0.11.0 or later, then change log.message.format.version to 0.11.0 on each broker and restart them one by one. Note that the older Scala consumer does not support the new message format, so to avoid the performance cost of down-conversion (or to take advantage of exactly once semantics), the new Java consumer must be used.
Additional Upgrade Notes:</p>
<p>If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start them back up. They will start with the new protocol by default.
Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers are upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after. Similarly for the message format version.
It is also possible to enable the 0.11.0 message format on individual topics using the topic admin tool (bin/kafka-topics.sh) prior to updating the global setting log.message.format.version.
If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.10.0, it is NOT necessary to first update the message format to 0.10.0 before you switch to 0.11.0.
Upgrading a 0.10.2 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.2 to 0.11.0 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 0.11.0 application can connect to 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
If you specify customized key.serde, value.serde and timestamp.extractor in configs, it is recommended to use their replaced configure parameter as these configs are deprecated.
See Streams API changes in 0.11.0 for more details.
Upgrading a 0.10.1 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.1 to 0.11.0 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 0.11.0 application can connect to 0.11.0, 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
You need to recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and will break your application.
If you specify customized key.serde, value.serde and timestamp.extractor in configs, it is recommended to use their replaced configure parameter as these configs are deprecated.
If you use a custom (i.e., user implemented) timestamp extractor, you will need to update this code, because the TimestampExtractor interface was changed.
If you register custom metrics, you will need to update this code, because the StreamsMetric interface was changed.
See Streams API changes in 0.11.0 and Streams API changes in 0.10.2 for more details.
Upgrading a 0.10.0 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0 does require a broker upgrade because a Kafka Streams 0.11.0 application can only connect to 0.11.0, 0.10.2, or 0.10.1 brokers.
There are couple of API changes, that are not backward compatible (cf. Streams API changes in 0.11.0, Streams API changes in 0.10.2, and Streams API changes in 0.10.1 for more details). Thus, you need to update and recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and will break your application.
Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.11.0.3 requires two rolling bounces with config upgrade.from=”0.10.0” set for first upgrade phase (cf. KIP-268). As an alternative, an offline upgrade is also possible.
prepare your application instances for a rolling bounce and make sure that config upgrade.from is set to “0.10.0” for new version 0.11.0.3
bounce each instance of your application once
prepare your newly deployed 0.11.0.3 application instances for a second round of rolling bounces; make sure to remove the value for config upgrade.mode
bounce each instance of your application once more to complete the upgrade
Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.11.0.0, 0.11.0.1, or 0.11.0.2 requires an offline upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)
stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances
update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code and new jar file
restart all new (0.11.0.0 , 0.11.0.1, or 0.11.0.2) application instances
Notable changes in 0.11.0.3
New Kafka Streams configuration parameter upgrade.from added that allows rolling bounce upgrade from version 0.10.0.x
See the Kafka Streams upgrade guide for details about this new config.
Notable changes in 0.11.0.0
Unclean leader election is now disabled by default. The new default favors durability over availability. Users who wish to to retain the previous behavior should set the broker config unclean.leader.election.enable to true.
Producer configs block.on.buffer.full, metadata.fetch.timeout.ms and timeout.ms have been removed. They were initially deprecated in Kafka 0.9.0.0.
The offsets.topic.replication.factor broker config is now enforced upon auto topic creation. Internal auto topic creation will fail with a GROUP_COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE error until the cluster size meets this replication factor requirement.
When compressing data with snappy, the producer and broker will use the compression scheme’s default block size (2 x 32 KB) instead of 1 KB in order to improve the compression ratio. There have been reports of data compressed with the smaller block size being 50% larger than when compressed with the larger block size. For the snappy case, a producer with 5000 partitions will require an additional 315 MB of JVM heap.
Similarly, when compressing data with gzip, the producer and broker will use 8 KB instead of 1 KB as the buffer size. The default for gzip is excessively low (512 bytes).
The broker configuration max.message.bytes now applies to the total size of a batch of messages. Previously the setting applied to batches of compressed messages, or to non-compressed messages individually. A message batch may consist of only a single message, so in most cases, the limitation on the size of individual messages is only reduced by the overhead of the batch format. However, there are some subtle implications for message format conversion (see below for more detail). Note also that while previously the broker would ensure that at least one message is returned in each fetch request (regardless of the total and partition-level fetch sizes), the same behavior now applies to one message batch.
GC log rotation is enabled by default, see KAFKA-3754 for details.
Deprecated constructors of RecordMetadata, MetricName and Cluster classes have been removed.
Added user headers support through a new Headers interface providing user headers read and write access.
ProducerRecord and ConsumerRecord expose the new Headers API via Headers headers() method call.
ExtendedSerializer and ExtendedDeserializer interfaces are introduced to support serialization and deserialization for headers. Headers will be ignored if the configured serializer and deserializer are not the above classes.
A new config, group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms, was introduced. This config specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the GroupCoordinator will delay the initial consumer rebalance. The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms as new members join the group, up to a maximum of max.poll.interval.ms. The default value for this is 3 seconds. During development and testing it might be desirable to set this to 0 in order to not delay test execution time.
org.apache.kafka.common.Cluster#partitionsForTopic, partitionsForNode and availablePartitionsForTopic methods will return an empty list instead of null (which is considered a bad practice) in case the metadata for the required topic does not exist.
Streams API configuration parameters timestamp.extractor, key.serde, and value.serde were deprecated and replaced by default.timestamp.extractor, default.key.serde, and default.value.serde, respectively.
For offset commit failures in the Java consumer’s commitAsync APIs, we no longer expose the underlying cause when instances of RetriableCommitFailedException are passed to the commit callback. See KAFKA-5052 for more detail.
New Protocol Versions
KIP-107: FetchRequest v5 introduces a partition-level log_start_offset field.
KIP-107: FetchResponse v5 introduces a partition-level log_start_offset field.
KIP-82: ProduceRequest v3 introduces an array of header in the message protocol, containing key field and value field.
KIP-82: FetchResponse v5 introduces an array of header in the message protocol, containing key field and value field.
Notes on Exactly Once Semantics
Kafka 0.11.0 includes support for idempotent and transactional capabilities in the producer. Idempotent delivery ensures that messages are delivered exactly once to a particular topic partition during the lifetime of a single producer. Transactional delivery allows producers to send data to multiple partitions such that either all messages are successfully delivered, or none of them are. Together, these capabilities enable “exactly once semantics” in Kafka. More details on these features are available in the user guide, but below we add a few specific notes on enabling them in an upgraded cluster. Note that enabling EoS is not required and there is no impact on the broker’s behavior if unused.</p>
<p>Only the new Java producer and consumer support exactly once semantics.
These features depend crucially on the 0.11.0 message format. Attempting to use them on an older format will result in unsupported version errors.
Transaction state is stored in a new internal topic __transaction_state. This topic is not created until the the first attempt to use a transactional request API. Similar to the consumer offsets topic, there are several settings to control the topic’s configuration. For example, transaction.state.log.min.isr controls the minimum ISR for this topic. See the configuration section in the user guide for a full list of options.
For secure clusters, the transactional APIs require new ACLs which can be turned on with the bin/kafka-acls.sh. tool.
EoS in Kafka introduces new request APIs and modifies several existing ones. See KIP-98 for the full details
Notes on the new message format in 0.11.0
The 0.11.0 message format includes several major enhancements in order to support better delivery semantics for the producer (see KIP-98) and improved replication fault tolerance (see KIP-101). Although the new format contains more information to make these improvements possible, we have made the batch format much more efficient. As long as the number of messages per batch is more than 2, you can expect lower overall overhead. For smaller batches, however, there may be a small performance impact. See here for the results of our initial performance analysis of the new message format. You can also find more detail on the message format in the KIP-98 proposal.</p>
<p>One of the notable differences in the new message format is that even uncompressed messages are stored together as a single batch. This has a few implications for the broker configuration max.message.bytes, which limits the size of a single batch. First, if an older client produces messages to a topic partition using the old format, and the messages are individually smaller than max.message.bytes, the broker may still reject them after they are merged into a single batch during the up-conversion process. Generally this can happen when the aggregate size of the individual messages is larger than max.message.bytes. There is a similar effect for older consumers reading messages down-converted from the new format: if the fetch size is not set at least as large as max.message.bytes, the consumer may not be able to make progress even if the individual uncompressed messages are smaller than the configured fetch size. This behavior does not impact the Java client for 0.10.1.0 and later since it uses an updated fetch protocol which ensures that at least one message can be returned even if it exceeds the fetch size. To get around these problems, you should ensure 1) that the producer’s batch size is not set larger than max.message.bytes, and 2) that the consumer’s fetch size is set at least as large as max.message.bytes.</p>
<p>Most of the discussion on the performance impact of upgrading to the 0.10.0 message format remains pertinent to the 0.11.0 upgrade. This mainly affects clusters that are not secured with TLS since “zero-copy” transfer is already not possible in that case. In order to avoid the cost of down-conversion, you should ensure that consumer applications are upgraded to the latest 0.11.0 client. Significantly, since the old consumer has been deprecated in 0.11.0.0, it does not support the new message format. You must upgrade to use the new consumer to use the new message format without the cost of down-conversion. Note that 0.11.0 consumers support backwards compatibility with 0.10.0 brokers and upward, so it is possible to upgrade the clients first before the brokers.</p>
<p>Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.0.x or 0.10.1.x to 0.10.2.0
0.10.2.0 has wire protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade. However, please review the notable changes in 0.10.2.0 before upgrading.</p>
<p>Starting with version 0.10.2, Java clients (producer and consumer) have acquired the ability to communicate with older brokers. Version 0.10.2 clients can talk to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers. However, if your brokers are older than 0.10.0, you must upgrade all the brokers in the Kafka cluster before upgrading your clients. Version 0.10.2 brokers support 0.8.x and newer clients.</p>
<p>For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following properties:
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2, 0.9.0, 0.10.0 or 0.10.1).
log.message.format.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)
Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the code, and restart it.
Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.10.2.
If your previous message format is 0.10.0, change log.message.format.version to 0.10.2 (this is a no-op as the message format is the same for 0.10.0, 0.10.1 and 0.10.2). If your previous message format version is lower than 0.10.0, do not change log.message.format.version yet - this parameter should only change once all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0.0 or later.
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect.
If log.message.format.version is still lower than 0.10.0 at this point, wait until all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0 or later, then change log.message.format.version to 0.10.2 on each broker and restart them one by one.
Note: If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start all of them. They will start with the new protocol by default.</p>
<p>Note: Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers were upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after.</p>
<p>Upgrading a 0.10.1 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.1 to 0.10.2 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 0.10.2 application can connect to 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
You need to recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and will break your application.
If you use a custom (i.e., user implemented) timestamp extractor, you will need to update this code, because the TimestampExtractor interface was changed.
If you register custom metrics, you will need to update this code, because the StreamsMetric interface was changed.
See Streams API changes in 0.10.2 for more details.
Upgrading a 0.10.0 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.0 to 0.10.2 does require a broker upgrade because a Kafka Streams 0.10.2 application can only connect to 0.10.2 or 0.10.1 brokers.
There are couple of API changes, that are not backward compatible (cf. Streams API changes in 0.10.2 for more details). Thus, you need to update and recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and will break your application.
Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.2.2 requires two rolling bounces with config upgrade.from=”0.10.0” set for first upgrade phase (cf. KIP-268). As an alternative, an offline upgrade is also possible.
prepare your application instances for a rolling bounce and make sure that config upgrade.from is set to “0.10.0” for new version 0.10.2.2
bounce each instance of your application once
prepare your newly deployed 0.10.2.2 application instances for a second round of rolling bounces; make sure to remove the value for config upgrade.mode
bounce each instance of your application once more to complete the upgrade
Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.2.0 or 0.10.2.1 requires an offline upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)
stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances
update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code and new jar file
restart all new (0.10.2.0 or 0.10.2.1) application instances
Notable changes in 0.10.2.2
New configuration parameter upgrade.from added that allows rolling bounce upgrade from version 0.10.0.x
Notable changes in 0.10.2.1
The default values for two configurations of the StreamsConfig class were changed to improve the resiliency of Kafka Streams applications. The internal Kafka Streams producer retries default value was changed from 0 to 10. The internal Kafka Streams consumer max.poll.interval.ms default value was changed from 300000 to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
Notable changes in 0.10.2.0
The Java clients (producer and consumer) have acquired the ability to communicate with older brokers. Version 0.10.2 clients can talk to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers. Note that some features are not available or are limited when older brokers are used.
Several methods on the Java consumer may now throw InterruptException if the calling thread is interrupted. Please refer to the KafkaConsumer Javadoc for a more in-depth explanation of this change.
Java consumer now shuts down gracefully. By default, the consumer waits up to 30 seconds to complete pending requests. A new close API with timeout has been added to KafkaConsumer to control the maximum wait time.
Multiple regular expressions separated by commas can be passed to MirrorMaker with the new Java consumer via the –whitelist option. This makes the behaviour consistent with MirrorMaker when used the old Scala consumer.
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.1 to 0.10.2 does not require a broker upgrade. A Kafka Streams 0.10.2 application can connect to 0.10.2 and 0.10.1 brokers (it is not possible to connect to 0.10.0 brokers though).
The Zookeeper dependency was removed from the Streams API. The Streams API now uses the Kafka protocol to manage internal topics instead of modifying Zookeeper directly. This eliminates the need for privileges to access Zookeeper directly and “StreamsConfig.ZOOKEEPER_CONFIG” should not be set in the Streams app any more. If the Kafka cluster is secured, Streams apps must have the required security privileges to create new topics.
Several new fields including “security.protocol”, “connections.max.idle.ms”, “retry.backoff.ms”, “reconnect.backoff.ms” and “request.timeout.ms” were added to StreamsConfig class. User should pay attention to the default values and set these if needed. For more details please refer to 3.5 Kafka Streams Configs.
New Protocol Versions
KIP-88: OffsetFetchRequest v2 supports retrieval of offsets for all topics if the topics array is set to null.
KIP-88: OffsetFetchResponse v2 introduces a top-level error_code field.
KIP-103: UpdateMetadataRequest v3 introduces a listener_name field to the elements of the end_points array.
KIP-108: CreateTopicsRequest v1 introduces a validate_only field.
KIP-108: CreateTopicsResponse v1 introduces an error_message field to the elements of the topic_errors array.
Upgrading from 0.8.x, 0.9.x or 0.10.0.X to 0.10.1.0
0.10.1.0 has wire protocol changes. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime during the upgrade. However, please notice the Potential breaking changes in 0.10.1.0 before upgrade.
Note: Because new protocols are introduced, it is important to upgrade your Kafka clusters before upgrading your clients (i.e. 0.10.1.x clients only support 0.10.1.x or later brokers while 0.10.1.x brokers also support older clients).
For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following properties:
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2.0, 0.9.0.0 or 0.10.0.0).
log.message.format.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)
Upgrade the brokers one at a time: shut down the broker, update the code, and restart it.
Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.10.1.0.
If your previous message format is 0.10.0, change log.message.format.version to 0.10.1 (this is a no-op as the message format is the same for both 0.10.0 and 0.10.1). If your previous message format version is lower than 0.10.0, do not change log.message.format.version yet - this parameter should only change once all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0.0 or later.
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect.
If log.message.format.version is still lower than 0.10.0 at this point, wait until all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0 or later, then change log.message.format.version to 0.10.1 on each broker and restart them one by one.
Note: If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start all of them. They will start with the new protocol by default.</p>
<p>Note: Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers were upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after.
Potential breaking changes in 0.10.1.0
The log retention time is no longer based on last modified time of the log segments. Instead it will be based on the largest timestamp of the messages in a log segment.
The log rolling time is no longer depending on log segment create time. Instead it is now based on the timestamp in the messages. More specifically. if the timestamp of the first message in the segment is T, the log will be rolled out when a new message has a timestamp greater than or equal to T + log.roll.ms
The open file handlers of 0.10.0 will increase by ~33% because of the addition of time index files for each segment.
The time index and offset index share the same index size configuration. Since each time index entry is 1.5x the size of offset index entry. User may need to increase log.index.size.max.bytes to avoid potential frequent log rolling.
Due to the increased number of index files, on some brokers with large amount the log segments (e.g. &gt;15K), the log loading process during the broker startup could be longer. Based on our experiment, setting the num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir to one may reduce the log loading time.
Upgrading a 0.10.0 Kafka Streams Application
Upgrading your Streams application from 0.10.0 to 0.10.1 does require a broker upgrade because a Kafka Streams 0.10.1 application can only connect to 0.10.1 brokers.
There are couple of API changes, that are not backward compatible (cf. Streams API changes in 0.10.1 for more details). Thus, you need to update and recompile your code. Just swapping the Kafka Streams library jar file will not work and will break your application.
Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.1.2 requires two rolling bounces with config upgrade.from=”0.10.0” set for first upgrade phase (cf. KIP-268). As an alternative, an offline upgrade is also possible.
prepare your application instances for a rolling bounce and make sure that config upgrade.from is set to “0.10.0” for new version 0.10.1.2
bounce each instance of your application once
prepare your newly deployed 0.10.1.2 application instances for a second round of rolling bounces; make sure to remove the value for config upgrade.mode
bounce each instance of your application once more to complete the upgrade
Upgrading from 0.10.0.x to 0.10.1.0 or 0.10.1.1 requires an offline upgrade (rolling bounce upgrade is not supported)
stop all old (0.10.0.x) application instances
update your code and swap old code and jar file with new code and new jar file
restart all new (0.10.1.0 or 0.10.1.1) application instances
Notable changes in 0.10.1.0
The new Java consumer is no longer in beta and we recommend it for all new development. The old Scala consumers are still supported, but they will be deprecated in the next release and will be removed in a future major release.
The –new-consumer/–new.consumer switch is no longer required to use tools like MirrorMaker and the Console Consumer with the new consumer; one simply needs to pass a Kafka broker to connect to instead of the ZooKeeper ensemble. In addition, usage of the Console Consumer with the old consumer has been deprecated and it will be removed in a future major release.
Kafka clusters can now be uniquely identified by a cluster id. It will be automatically generated when a broker is upgraded to 0.10.1.0. The cluster id is available via the kafka.server:type=KafkaServer,name=ClusterId metric and it is part of the Metadata response. Serializers, client interceptors and metric reporters can receive the cluster id by implementing the ClusterResourceListener interface.
The BrokerState “RunningAsController” (value 4) has been removed. Due to a bug, a broker would only be in this state briefly before transitioning out of it and hence the impact of the removal should be minimal. The recommended way to detect if a given broker is the controller is via the kafka.controller:type=KafkaController,name=ActiveControllerCount metric.
The new Java Consumer now allows users to search offsets by timestamp on partitions.
The new Java Consumer now supports heartbeating from a background thread. There is a new configuration max.poll.interval.ms which controls the maximum time between poll invocations before the consumer will proactively leave the group (5 minutes by default). The value of the configuration request.timeout.ms must always be larger than max.poll.interval.ms because this is the maximum time that a JoinGroup request can block on the server while the consumer is rebalancing, so we have changed its default value to just above 5 minutes. Finally, the default value of session.timeout.ms has been adjusted down to 10 seconds, and the default value of max.poll.records has been changed to 500.
When using an Authorizer and a user doesn’t have Describe authorization on a topic, the broker will no longer return TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED errors to requests since this leaks topic names. Instead, the UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION error code will be returned. This may cause unexpected timeouts or delays when using the producer and consumer since Kafka clients will typically retry automatically on unknown topic errors. You should consult the client logs if you suspect this could be happening.
Fetch responses have a size limit by default (50 MB for consumers and 10 MB for replication). The existing per partition limits also apply (1 MB for consumers and replication). Note that neither of these limits is an absolute maximum as explained in the next point.
Consumers and replicas can make progress if a message larger than the response/partition size limit is found. More concretely, if the first message in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than either or both limits, the message will still be returned.
Overloaded constructors were added to kafka.api.FetchRequest and kafka.javaapi.FetchRequest to allow the caller to specify the order of the partitions (since order is significant in v3). The previously existing constructors were deprecated and the partitions are shuffled before the request is sent to avoid starvation issues.
New Protocol Versions
ListOffsetRequest v1 supports accurate offset search based on timestamps.
MetadataResponse v2 introduces a new field: “cluster_id”.
FetchRequest v3 supports limiting the response size (in addition to the existing per partition limit), it returns messages bigger than the limits if required to make progress and the order of partitions in the request is now significant.
JoinGroup v1 introduces a new field: “rebalance_timeout”.
Upgrading from 0.8.x or 0.9.x to 0.10.0.0
0.10.0.0 has potential breaking changes (please review before upgrading) and possible performance impact following the upgrade. By following the recommended rolling upgrade plan below, you guarantee no downtime and no performance impact during and following the upgrade.
Note: Because new protocols are introduced, it is important to upgrade your Kafka clusters before upgrading your clients.</p>
<p>Notes to clients with version 0.9.0.0: Due to a bug introduced in 0.9.0.0, clients that depend on ZooKeeper (old Scala high-level Consumer and MirrorMaker if used with the old consumer) will not work with 0.10.0.x brokers. Therefore, 0.9.0.0 clients should be upgraded to 0.9.0.1 before brokers are upgraded to 0.10.0.x. This step is not necessary for 0.8.X or 0.9.0.1 clients.</p>
<p>For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following properties:
inter.broker.protocol.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (e.g. 0.8.2 or 0.9.0.0).
log.message.format.version=CURRENT_KAFKA_VERSION (See potential performance impact following the upgrade for the details on what this configuration does.)
Upgrade the brokers. This can be done a broker at a time by simply bringing it down, updating the code, and restarting it.
Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.10.0.0. NOTE: You shouldn’t touch log.message.format.version yet - this parameter should only change once all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0.0
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect.
Once all consumers have been upgraded to 0.10.0, change log.message.format.version to 0.10.0 on each broker and restart them one by one.
Note: If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start all of them. They will start with the new protocol by default.</p>
<p>Note: Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers were upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after.</p>
<p>Potential performance impact following upgrade to 0.10.0.0
The message format in 0.10.0 includes a new timestamp field and uses relative offsets for compressed messages. The on disk message format can be configured through log.message.format.version in the server.properties file. The default on-disk message format is 0.10.0. If a consumer client is on a version before 0.10.0.0, it only understands message formats before 0.10.0. In this case, the broker is able to convert messages from the 0.10.0 format to an earlier format before sending the response to the consumer on an older version. However, the broker can’t use zero-copy transfer in this case. Reports from the Kafka community on the performance impact have shown CPU utilization going from 20% before to 100% after an upgrade, which forced an immediate upgrade of all clients to bring performance back to normal. To avoid such message conversion before consumers are upgraded to 0.10.0.0, one can set log.message.format.version to 0.8.2 or 0.9.0 when upgrading the broker to 0.10.0.0. This way, the broker can still use zero-copy transfer to send the data to the old consumers. Once consumers are upgraded, one can change the message format to 0.10.0 on the broker and enjoy the new message format that includes new timestamp and improved compression. The conversion is supported to ensure compatibility and can be useful to support a few apps that have not updated to newer clients yet, but is impractical to support all consumer traffic on even an overprovisioned cluster. Therefore, it is critical to avoid the message conversion as much as possible when brokers have been upgraded but the majority of clients have not.</p>
<p>For clients that are upgraded to 0.10.0.0, there is no performance impact.</p>
<p>Note: By setting the message format version, one certifies that all existing messages are on or below that message format version. Otherwise consumers before 0.10.0.0 might break. In particular, after the message format is set to 0.10.0, one should not change it back to an earlier format as it may break consumers on versions before 0.10.0.0.</p>
<p>Note: Due to the additional timestamp introduced in each message, producers sending small messages may see a message throughput degradation because of the increased overhead. Likewise, replication now transmits an additional 8 bytes per message. If you’re running close to the network capacity of your cluster, it’s possible that you’ll overwhelm the network cards and see failures and performance issues due to the overload.</p>
<p>Note: If you have enabled compression on producers, you may notice reduced producer throughput and/or lower compression rate on the broker in some cases. When receiving compressed messages, 0.10.0 brokers avoid recompressing the messages, which in general reduces the latency and improves the throughput. In certain cases, however, this may reduce the batching size on the producer, which could lead to worse throughput. If this happens, users can tune linger.ms and batch.size of the producer for better throughput. In addition, the producer buffer used for compressing messages with snappy is smaller than the one used by the broker, which may have a negative impact on the compression ratio for the messages on disk. We intend to make this configurable in a future Kafka release.
Potential breaking changes in 0.10.0.0
Starting from Kafka 0.10.0.0, the message format version in Kafka is represented as the Kafka version. For example, message format 0.9.0 refers to the highest message version supported by Kafka 0.9.0.
Message format 0.10.0 has been introduced and it is used by default. It includes a timestamp field in the messages and relative offsets are used for compressed messages.
ProduceRequest/Response v2 has been introduced and it is used by default to support message format 0.10.0
FetchRequest/Response v2 has been introduced and it is used by default to support message format 0.10.0
MessageFormatter interface was changed from def writeTo(key: Array[Byte], value: Array[Byte], output: PrintStream) to def writeTo(consumerRecord: ConsumerRecord[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]], output: PrintStream)
MessageReader interface was changed from def readMessage(): KeyedMessage[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]] to def readMessage(): ProducerRecord[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]]
MessageFormatter’s package was changed from kafka.tools to kafka.common
MessageReader’s package was changed from kafka.tools to kafka.common
MirrorMakerMessageHandler no longer exposes the handle(record: MessageAndMetadata[Array[Byte], Array[Byte]]) method as it was never called.
The 0.7 KafkaMigrationTool is no longer packaged with Kafka. If you need to migrate from 0.7 to 0.10.0, please migrate to 0.8 first and then follow the documented upgrade process to upgrade from 0.8 to 0.10.0.
The new consumer has standardized its APIs to accept java.util.Collection as the sequence type for method parameters. Existing code may have to be updated to work with the 0.10.0 client library.
LZ4-compressed message handling was changed to use an interoperable framing specification (LZ4f v1.5.1). To maintain compatibility with old clients, this change only applies to Message format 0.10.0 and later. Clients that Produce/Fetch LZ4-compressed messages using v0/v1 (Message format 0.9.0) should continue to use the 0.9.0 framing implementation. Clients that use Produce/Fetch protocols v2 or later should use interoperable LZ4f framing. A list of interoperable LZ4 libraries is available at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lz4.org/">http://www.lz4.org/</a>
Notable changes in 0.10.0.0
Starting from Kafka 0.10.0.0, a new client library named Kafka Streams is available for stream processing on data stored in Kafka topics. This new client library only works with 0.10.x and upward versioned brokers due to message format changes mentioned above. For more information please read Streams documentation.
The default value of the configuration parameter receive.buffer.bytes is now 64K for the new consumer.
The new consumer now exposes the configuration parameter exclude.internal.topics to restrict internal topics (such as the consumer offsets topic) from accidentally being included in regular expression subscriptions. By default, it is enabled.
The old Scala producer has been deprecated. Users should migrate their code to the Java producer included in the kafka-clients JAR as soon as possible.
The new consumer API has been marked stable.
Upgrading from 0.8.0, 0.8.1.X, or 0.8.2.X to 0.9.0.0
0.9.0.0 has potential breaking changes (please review before upgrading) and an inter-broker protocol change from previous versions. This means that upgraded brokers and clients may not be compatible with older versions. It is important that you upgrade your Kafka cluster before upgrading your clients. If you are using MirrorMaker downstream clusters should be upgraded first as well.
For a rolling upgrade:</p>
<p>Update server.properties file on all brokers and add the following property: inter.broker.protocol.version=0.8.2.X
Upgrade the brokers. This can be done a broker at a time by simply bringing it down, updating the code, and restarting it.
Once the entire cluster is upgraded, bump the protocol version by editing inter.broker.protocol.version and setting it to 0.9.0.0.
Restart the brokers one by one for the new protocol version to take effect
Note: If you are willing to accept downtime, you can simply take all the brokers down, update the code and start all of them. They will start with the new protocol by default.</p>
<p>Note: Bumping the protocol version and restarting can be done any time after the brokers were upgraded. It does not have to be immediately after.</p>
<p>Potential breaking changes in 0.9.0.0
Java 1.6 is no longer supported.
Scala 2.9 is no longer supported.
Broker IDs above 1000 are now reserved by default to automatically assigned broker IDs. If your cluster has existing broker IDs above that threshold make sure to increase the reserved.broker.max.id broker configuration property accordingly.
Configuration parameter replica.lag.max.messages was removed. Partition leaders will no longer consider the number of lagging messages when deciding which replicas are in sync.
Configuration parameter replica.lag.time.max.ms now refers not just to the time passed since last fetch request from replica, but also to time since the replica last caught up. Replicas that are still fetching messages from leaders but did not catch up to the latest messages in replica.lag.time.max.ms will be considered out of sync.
Compacted topics no longer accept messages without key and an exception is thrown by the producer if this is attempted. In 0.8.x, a message without key would cause the log compaction thread to subsequently complain and quit (and stop compacting all compacted topics).
MirrorMaker no longer supports multiple target clusters. As a result it will only accept a single –consumer.config parameter. To mirror multiple source clusters, you will need at least one MirrorMaker instance per source cluster, each with its own consumer configuration.
Tools packaged under org.apache.kafka.clients.tools.* have been moved to org.apache.kafka.tools.*. All included scripts will still function as usual, only custom code directly importing these classes will be affected.
The default Kafka JVM performance options (KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS) have been changed in kafka-run-class.sh.
The kafka-topics.sh script (kafka.admin.TopicCommand) now exits with non-zero exit code on failure.
The kafka-topics.sh script (kafka.admin.TopicCommand) will now print a warning when topic names risk metric collisions due to the use of a ‘.’ or ‘_’ in the topic name, and error in the case of an actual collision.
The kafka-console-producer.sh script (kafka.tools.ConsoleProducer) will use the Java producer instead of the old Scala producer be default, and users have to specify ‘old-producer’ to use the old producer.
By default, all command line tools will print all logging messages to stderr instead of stdout.
Notable changes in 0.9.0.1
The new broker id generation feature can be disabled by setting broker.id.generation.enable to false.
Configuration parameter log.cleaner.enable is now true by default. This means topics with a cleanup.policy=compact will now be compacted by default, and 128 MB of heap will be allocated to the cleaner process via log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size. You may want to review log.cleaner.dedupe.buffer.size and the other log.cleaner configuration values based on your usage of compacted topics.
Default value of configuration parameter fetch.min.bytes for the new consumer is now 1 by default.
Deprecations in 0.9.0.0
Altering topic configuration from the kafka-topics.sh script (kafka.admin.TopicCommand) has been deprecated. Going forward, please use the kafka-configs.sh script (kafka.admin.ConfigCommand) for this functionality.
The kafka-consumer-offset-checker.sh (kafka.tools.ConsumerOffsetChecker) has been deprecated. Going forward, please use kafka-consumer-groups.sh (kafka.admin.ConsumerGroupCommand) for this functionality.
The kafka.tools.ProducerPerformance class has been deprecated. Going forward, please use org.apache.kafka.tools.ProducerPerformance for this functionality (kafka-producer-perf-test.sh will also be changed to use the new class).
The producer config block.on.buffer.full has been deprecated and will be removed in future release. Currently its default value has been changed to false. The KafkaProducer will no longer throw BufferExhaustedException but instead will use max.block.ms value to block, after which it will throw a TimeoutException.

Upgrading from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2
0.8.2 is fully compatible with 0.8.1. The upgrade can be done one broker at a time by simply bringing it down, updating the code, and restarting it.
Upgrading from 0.8.0 to 0.8.1
0.8.1 is fully compatible with 0.8. The upgrade can be done one broker at a time by simply bringing it down, updating the code, and restarting it.
Upgrading from 0.7
Release 0.7 is incompatible with newer releases. Major changes were made to the API, ZooKeeper data structures, and protocol, and configuration in order to add replication (Which was missing in 0.7). The upgrade from 0.7 to later versions requires a special tool for migration. This migration can be done without downtime.</p>
